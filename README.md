# Git Interactive

A visual tool for understanding version control with git.

## Description

This is a learning-only tool.  It will not modify any of your files.  It just provides a visual explanation for developers learning the main git commands: `add`, `commit`, and `push`. 

Switch between a visual dashboard and mock terminal to test out version control for GitHub without the mess of a real project.

## Testing

1. Clone the project to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/eerickson5/git-interactive
```
 2. Navigate to the project
 ```
 cd git-interactive
 ```
 3. Make sure all dependencies are downloaded.
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 4. Run the app on a development server
 ```
 npm start
 ```
 5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) if it wasn't opened by default
