# Git Interactive

A visual tool for understanding version control with git.

## Description

This is a learning-only tool.  It will not modify any of your files.  It just provides a visual explanation for developers learning the main git commands: `add`, `commit`, and `push`. 

Switch between a visual dashboard and mock terminal to test out version control for GitHub without the mess of a real project.

## Installation

1. Clone the project to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/eerickson5/git-interactive

 2. Navigate to the project

 ```
 3. Make sure all dependencies are downloaded.

 4. Run the app on a development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
 ```

 ```

 ## Contributing

 Pull requests are always welcome.  I would love to develop this project with someone and learn that side of git/GitHub as well.
