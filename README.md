## ðŸ–² Description

Git Interactive teaches gives young developers a visual reference for what goes on under the hood for the main git commands: `add`, `commit`, and `push`.  There are boxes for each of the 4 states your changes could be in: the working directory, staging area, local repo, and remote repo and an output window with the same output logs you would see using git in a terminal.  Users can switch between a visual dashboard with buttons and mock terminal to test out version control for GitHub without the mess of a real project.

This is a learning-only tool.  It will not modify any of your files.
